# NodeJS JWT Authentication sample

This is a NodeJS API that supports username and password authentication with JWTs and has APIs that return Chuck Norris phrases. How awesome is that?

## Available APIs

### User APIs

#### POST `/users`

You can do a POST to `/users` to create a new user.

The body must have:

* `username`: The username
* `password`: The password
* `extra`: Some extra information you want to save from the user (It's a string). This could be a color or anything at all.

It returns the following:

```json
{
  "id_token": {jwt},
  "access_token": {jwt}
}
```

The `id_token` and `access_token` are signed with the secret located at the `config.json` file. The `id_token` will contain the `username` and the `extra` information sent, while the `access_token` will contain the `audience`, `jti`, `issuer` and `scope`.

#### POST `/sessions/create`

You can do a POST to `/sessions/create` to log a user in.

The body must have:

* `username`: The username
* `password`: The password

It returns the following:

```json
{
  "id_token": {jwt},
  "access_token": {jwt}
}
```

The `id_token` and `access_token` are signed with the secret located at the `config.json` file. The `id_token` will contain the `username` and the `extra` information sent, while the `access_token` will contain the `audience`, `jti`, `issuer` and `scope`.
